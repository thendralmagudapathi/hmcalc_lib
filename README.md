# hmcalc — Human-Centered Math for Python

Python is excellent at **performing raw calculations**.  
`hmcalc` excels at **contextualizing those numbers for human decision-making**.

`hmcalc` bridges the gap between machine precision and human intent.

It provides **opinionated, safe, human-semantic math primitives** for everyday decisions in analytics, business logic, monitoring, experiments, and reports.

## Install

```bash
pip install hmcalc
```

No dependencies. Works with standard Python.

## Why hmcalc exists

Every Python developer repeatedly writes manual logic to interpret data:

```python
diff = new - old

if old != 0:
    pct = (diff / old) * 100
else:
    pct = None

if diff > 0:
    direction = "increase"
elif diff < 0:
    direction = "decrease"
else:
    direction = "same"
```

While functional, this approach often leads to:

- Redundant code written across different files.
- Inconsistencies in how teams label data.
- Manual handling of edge cases like division by zero.
- Cognitive load when reading logs or test results.

Python provides the raw math; humans need the meaningful interpretation.

`hmcalc` encodes the logic humans already use in their heads—change, growth, decline, closeness, stability—into a reliable, reusable API.

## What hmcalc does differently

While traditional tools focus on the mathematical result, `hmcalc` focuses on the meaning behind the result. It returns decision-ready answers, not just floating-point numbers.

## Core Concepts (with examples)

### 1. Change (Growth / Decline)

```python
from hmcalc import change

change(120, 150)
# Returns:
# {
#   "absolute": 30,
#   "percent": 25.0,
#   "direction": "increase"
# }
```

Automates boundary checks and provides clear semantic labels.

### 2. Percent (Safe by Default)

```python
from hmcalc import percent

percent(23, 0)
# Returns: None
```

By centralizing policy for undefined percentages, you prevent crashes and ensure data integrity across your stack.

### 3. Comparison (Human-Readable)

```python
from hmcalc import compare

compare(98, 100)
# Returns:
# {
#   "difference": -2,
#   "percent_diff": -2.0,
#   "close": true
# }
```

Perfect for monitoring, threshold checks, and writing tests that read like English.

### 4. Trend (Lightweight)

```python
from hmcalc import trend

trend([10, 12, 15, 18])
# Returns:
# {
#   "trend": "upward",
#   "strength": "strong",
#   "change_percent": 80.0
# }
```

A zero-dependency way to identify patterns in logs and small datasets.

### 5. Human Rounding

```python
from hmcalc import round_human

round_human(1234.567, sig=3)
# Returns: 1230
```

Presents numbers exactly how humans report them, emphasizing significant figures over machine precision.

## Extended Human Math Primitives

| Feature | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Closeness | Quantifies how "near" two numbers are. | Identifying duplicates or matching values. |
| Stability | Analyzes variation in a sequence. | Monitoring system health or metric volatility. |
| Normalize | Positions a value on a scale (0.0 - 1.0). | Building scorecards and dashboards. |
| Delta Category | Classifies the size of a change. | Automated executive summaries. |
| Range Summary | Summarizes the spread of data. | Quick visibility into data distribution. |

## How hmcalc complements existing tools

`hmcalc` is designed to sit alongside your favorite libraries. While numpy or pandas handle massive datasets and high-precision computation, `hmcalc` handles the final layer of interpretation.

| Traditional Tools | hmcalc |
|-------------------|--------|
| Focus on precision | Focus on meaning |
| Raw numbers | Structured answers |
| Low-level math | Intent-level math |
| Developer decides semantics | Semantics are standardized |
| Calculation-oriented | Decision-oriented |

## Design Principles

- **Opinionated defaults:** Reducing the need for boilerplate logic.
- **Safe by default:** Built-in protection against common errors like `ZeroDivisionError`.
- **No dependencies:** Keep your environment light and fast.
- **Predictable return shapes:** Functions return consistent dictionaries for easy parsing.
- **Human-readable labels:** Output is ready for logs, UI, or reports.

## Who should use hmcalc

If you find yourself manually checking if a number is "close enough" or calculating percent changes in multiple places, this library is for you. It is ideal for:

- Data & Analytics Engineers building reports.
- Backend Engineers writing business logic or alerts.
- Founders moving quickly to turn data into product features.

## Stability & API guarantees

- All functions return dictionaries for extensibility.
- Keys and labels are stable and documented.
- New features are strictly additive.
